Hello there 👋 !

My name is Álvaro (a.k.a. Aquelarre), I'm a spanish teenager who loves both coding and learning. 
I started my coding adventure almost a year ago, so don't expect any good code to be written here 😅 
 I'd say I "know" how to program on C++ and C, but my main language is JavaScript (p5.js specifically). 

I'm currently focused on exploring genetic algorithms, but I'm also interested in mixing AI and literature.
What else... I can communicate fluently in both spanish and english, and I can defend myself in french. Hope you have a great day and feel free to DM me.

Peace 😊
